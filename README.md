# Thr0w Client

## Introduction

The Thr0w Project is about building inexpensive and manageable interactive (or not) video walls using commodity hardware, web technologies, and open source software. The key to this solution is having one computer behind each screen networked to a single computer acting as a server. With this design, the splitting and synchronization of content is accomplished through software.

This repository is the project's client-side CSS and JavaScript libraries.
